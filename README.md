# Xylophone-iOS

This is the application developed for iOS Application which can run only in iPhone XS Max where you can press the button and upon pressing the button you will observe a sound of xylophone.

The program ViewController.swift contains the if statement if pressed at the one button a particular sound will be produced and if pressed another button another sound will be produced. 
 
This program can also have some modifications where you can call an array of tags from the particular method and then we will be able to play the particular sound for specific button clicked.

There are around three sounds which are repeated after every three buttons.
